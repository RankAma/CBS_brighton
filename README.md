These is my first time properly using R (ggplot2) to compile data and some of the scripts/lines are very messy.

Spindle analysis and live imaging data.
This is data i collected from observing microtubule length, microtuble width, metaphase plate and spindle ratio in mitotic cells
There is another file where i recorded the duration of time spent in G2 and M phase of the cell cycle.
